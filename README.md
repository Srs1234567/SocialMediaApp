# Social Media Platform using React, Node.js, and Firebase

Introduction

Social media platforms are interactive technologies that allow users to create or share information, ideas, career interests, and other forms of expression through online communities and networks. The vast number of social media services available, both independent and integrated with other platforms, can make defining them a challenge. However, some common features tie them together:

  - Interactive Web Applications: Social media platforms are interactive web applications built on Web 2.0 principles.
  - User-Generated Content: User-generated content, such as text posts, comments, photos, videos, and data from online interactions, is the foundation of social media.
  - User Profiles: Users create profiles specific to each platform, allowing them to build online identities.
  - Social Networks: Social media fosters online social networks by connecting users with others who share similar interests.
  - Mobile Accessibility: Users can access social media services through web browsers on desktops and laptops, or through mobile apps on smartphones and tablets. This widespread accessibility allows users to interact and create highly interactive platforms where individuals, communities, and organizations can share, co-create, discuss, and modify content.

Problem Description
